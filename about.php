The popularity gained by Chapayom is due to the expertise of Dr. Khanon Traichan (Assistant Professor of Prince of Songkla University) in the special recipe using quality ingredients. <br><br>On April 1, 2014, Dr. Khanon Traichan registered trademarks for Chapayom and began marketing his business through franchising in order to provide the tea to more consumers. In addition to the shops in Thailand, there are other stores opened in other countries. Countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia.<br><br>The name Chapayom is derived from "Cha" meaning tea and "Payom" meaning a type of tree that is widely grown in the province of Phattalhung. Phattalhung is the city were Dr. Khanon is from.</p>
